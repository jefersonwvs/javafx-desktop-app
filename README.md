# JavaFX Desktop App

This repository is a simple project on how to build GUI for Java desktop apps
using JavaFX, a Java platform for developing user interfaces.

With this project, I could learn the basics of the integration between layers from a desktop app:
- GUI: FXML views and controllers;
- Business logic: services;
- Persistence: entities and persistence API.

_The implementation is based on a [Java course](https://www.udemy.com/course/java-curso-completo/) available at Udemy, by [Nelio Alves](https://github.com/acenelio)._
